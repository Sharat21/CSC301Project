App Name: PlanIt 

PlanIt is a group trip planning app that streamlines the normally chaotic and often disorderly process. With PlanIt, everyone in the group gets to contribute their travel ideas, vote on the best options, and the app takes care of creating a final personalized itinerary based on the most popular chocies. It also ensures smooth coordination by integrating everyone's availability and helps manage expenses with a built-in budget tracking feature. 

Main features:
1. Interactive Planning Board
- Create a digital planning board for group members to pin ideas such as destinations, activities, housing/hotels, trip length, etc.
2. Voting System 
- Prior to set dates, members of the group will all be required to vote on the proposed ideas (from the planning board), ensuring a fair and democratic decision making process
3. Budget Tracking
- Ideas that have been accepted (or ideas already on the itinerary) will have their expenses placed on a budget sheet for everyone to see how much the trip costs so far
4. Feedback and Rating System (distinct from Voting System)
- Members will be able to "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" ideas on the planning board and provide feedback on why their like/dislike the idea so each member that posted an idea can receive constructive feedback
5. AI Tracking
- Use a AI API to give suggestions on trip info

What makes this app different from existing apps:
- Interactive planning board and voting system
